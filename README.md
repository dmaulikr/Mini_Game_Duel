# Mini_Game_Duel

This was a 5 week project created as a final project for my iOS application development class in college. Unfortunately, I wrote it before understanding the benefit of pushing it to a public git repo and relied solely on a local repo. Luckily, I still had the source code for the final project but the commit history is lost... Anyways, thought it was still worth pushing up.

I created a game, which wasn't part of the course curriculum, so I learned via a few tutorials first. Found the following tutorial especially useful in setting up the GameCenter code - https://www.raywenderlich.com/60980/game-center-tutorial-how-to-make-a-simple-multiplayer-game-with-sprite-kit-part-1.
